Am a mathematician with three years intermediate skill in computer programming. I am fond of
solving problems using mathematical methods implementing it with a computerized concept so I
have built so many projects which are available on GitHub and GitLab @georgegoldman, I enjoy
working in an environment where I learn new technologies and techniques to solve problems.
